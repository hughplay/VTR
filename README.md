Visual reasoning tasks mainly focus on static states and lack the ability to characterize or evaluate understanding of the fundamental aspect of the human world â€” "transformation." However, understanding transformation, a basic ability of human, is an essential path towards general artificial intelligence. To fill this gap, we propose the problem of visual transformation reasoning, aiming to investigate how machines can understand transformations. Given a set of images representing states, the objective is to infer the transformation or the sequence of atomic transformations that occurred between states.
